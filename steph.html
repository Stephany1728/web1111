             <p>I'm highly adaptable, detail-oriented, and communicative. 
            I consider myself to be a good team player. Although working alone is
             not a problem for me, I much rather collaborate on projects.
              I like to think of myself as tenacious and convincing.
              I enjoy learning new subjects. Being informed about (your field) 
              or any other subject takes constant effort, thus I'm constantly 
              looking for new ways to advance in my position. Increasing my expertise 
              in the profession is the driving force behind these possibilities, which 
              could take the shape of attending a conference, taking on a new project, 
              training, or attending a speaker.

        <p>I was born in Nairobi, brought up by two lovely parents. Im the first born in my family of four children
            I had a pretty good childhood. My grandmother's devotion for me was profound. I had a lot of 
            energy and enjoyed swimming and riding my bike. Anything involving horses was my favorite. 
            Being active was when I was happiest.

        <p>I have receeived education from nursery till date in my second year of university. I have received 
            rewards in subjects that I performed well in both primary scchool and high school. I was a very 
            active and energetic girl. I played football and volley ball in primary school and played for the school
            team. I competed with other schools up to national levels. In high school, same case, I played volleyball,
             handball,lawn tennis and bascketball. Played for the school team to national levels and got rewards and
              certificates. 
              My experience so far in campus has been amazing. I am currently doind a bachelor of science in information
               technology. It's the best experience ever i cant complain. I plan to grow better in areas i dont understand
         though so far so good.

             <p> Having free time for me has created a space for me to learn new skills and add to my talents. Especially
             during the corona period, while on lockdown, I taught myself on how to bake cakes and decorate them. I also
              taught myself on how to crochet sweaters and blankets. As we speak I have opened a business on selling cakes
              pastries and crocheted clothes online. For orders you can reach me through my social media platforms.

            <p>As an IT student, one of my career inspirations is Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft. I'm impressed by his 
            leadership in steering Microsoft towards a cloud-first approach, fostering innovation, and emphasizing the
            importance of continuous learning. His ability to navigate the rapidly evolving tech landscape motivates 
            me to stay adaptable and forward-thinking in my own career.
            Moreover, I find his commitment to fostering a positive organizational culture particularly inspiring. The 
            cultural transformation he initiated at Microsoft, driven by principles of empathy and inclusivity, aligns 
            seamlessly with my values. I believe that a strong and supportive workplace culture is essential for 
            driving creativity and productivity in the dynamic field of IT.
            Overall, I see Satya Nadella as a role model whose strategic vision, commitment to positive cultural change, 
            and emphasis on continuous learning align with my career aspirations in the dynamic and ever-evolving field of IT.
            As an IT student, my dreams include contributing to groundbreaking technological advancements, engaging in 
            innovative projects, and playing a key role in solving real-world challenges. I aspire to be a lifelong
            learner, staying abreast of emerging technologies, and making a positive impact through my work.
            Ultimately, I envision a career where I can combine creativity and technical expertise to shape the 
            future of technology.</p>
